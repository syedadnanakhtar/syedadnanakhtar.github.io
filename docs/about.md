# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Chair of Information Oriented Control at the Technical University of Munich, since Feb 2021. I hold a Masters's degree in Systems and Control at TU Delft. I enjoy working at the interface of Control, Robotics and Machine Learning. My research comprises (but not limited to) development of inverse optimal approaches (aka Inverse Reinforcement Learning) in the context of control. I enjoy working on application motivated problems, mostly finding their way to implementations. At the moment, I am involved at the ReHyb EU Project, led by TUM. We are aiming to develop an upper body hybrid exoskeleton to assist stroke patient's rehabilitation. If you are interested, I invite you to view our website at www.rehyb.eu. I am also consistently on a lookout for collaborations and motivated students who want to work with me, as a thesis or an internship.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
